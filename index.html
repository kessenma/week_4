<p> Hi, 

	This is a website dedicated to the different types of cookies in the world.</p> 

	<div>
	<p> here are some comments from my friends on what makes a high quality cookie:
		<blockquote> chewy and peanut buttery</blockquote>
		<blockquote>the taste</blockquote>
		<blockquote>The filling</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Taste</blockquote>
		<blockquote>CHOCOLATE</blockquote>
		<blockquote>If the cookie has a good texture. Firm, moist, and somewhat soft.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Love n support</blockquote>
		<blockquote>love</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Honest vegan ingredients, good people, and a lot of love</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Soft falls apart in your mouth not drying your mouth out and a tone of flavor</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Soft and chewy</blockquote>
		<!-- The flavor and texture
		chewy n warm
		Softness, quality ingredients, warm, no mint, served with milk, decent size that eating more than 1 or 2 doesn't make you feel guilty
		When you bite into them they are not hard, but rather semi chewy.
		Good taste
		Taste and consistency
		Crispy
		Fresh ingredients and a crisp outsides and chewy inside
		The taste, dough, texture
